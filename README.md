## Overview

An educational/administrative tool that records keystrokes with timestamps and, on command (pressing `ESC`), emails the log and deletes the local file. **Designed for lawful use only** (device owner testing, lab research, or explicit monitoring consent).

## Features

* Logs every keystroke with a timestamp.
* Human-readable special key names: `[SPACE]`, `[ENTER]`, `[TAB]`, `[BACKSPACE]`, `[ESC]`, etc.
* Press `ESC` to: send the current log as an email, securely delete the local log file, and stop the program.
* No hardcoded passwords — supports secure credentials via environment variables or a `.gitignored` config file.

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+.
* Internet connection (to send email).
* SMTP-capable email account (Gmail with App Password recommended).
