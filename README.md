# Email Integrated Keylogger

> **WARNING — Legal & Ethical:** This tool logs keystrokes and emails them. **Use only on devices you own or where you have explicit, written permission to monitor.** Unauthorized use is illegal and unethical. The author is not responsible for misuse.

---

## Overview

An educational/administrative tool that records keystrokes with timestamps and, on command (pressing `ESC`), emails the log and deletes the local file. **Designed for lawful use only** (device owner testing, lab research, or explicit monitoring consent).

---

## Features

- Logs every keystroke with a timestamp.
- Human-readable special key names: `[SPACE]`, `[ENTER]`, `[TAB]`, `[BACKSPACE]`, `[ESC]`, etc.
- Press `ESC` to: send the current log as an email, securely delete the local log file, and stop the program.
- No hardcoded passwords — supports secure credentials via environment variables or config file.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 (recommended via [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv))
- Internet connection (to send email)
- SMTP-capable email account (Gmail with App Password recommended)
